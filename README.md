# Winetasting Game
A command line tool that sets up a double-blind wine tasting experiment. This was my final project for CS50's Introduction to Python.

The script prompts users to create a double-blinded experiment where names of wines are entered, and random labels assigned. 

With an impartial observer completing the labelling, a double-blinded expermental model is created.

Future versions will calculate a "winner", and the data can be used for statistical analysis.
